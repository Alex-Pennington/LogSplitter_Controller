## 🎯 Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clear Separation**: Controller and Monitor are now separate, buildable projects
2. **Shared Code**: Common configuration and utilities in one place
3. **Easier Management**: Each project can be built and uploaded independently
4. **Better Organization**: Related files are grouped together
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new projects (like a third device type)

## 🔨 Building Projects

### Controller (Hydraulic Control System)
```bash
cd controller
pio run                    # Build
pio run --target upload    # Upload to device
```

### Monitor (Sensor Monitoring System) 
```bash
cd monitor
pio run                    # Build
pio run --target upload    # Upload to device
```

## 📋 What Was Moved

### Controller Project
- ✅ All main controller source files moved to `controller/src/`
- ✅ All controller headers moved to `controller/include/`
- ✅ Libraries moved to `controller/lib/`
- ✅ Tests moved to `controller/test/`
- ✅ PlatformIO config copied and updated

### Monitor Project  
- ✅ Already in `monitor/` directory
- ✅ PlatformIO config updated to reference shared includes

### Shared Components
- ✅ `arduino_secrets.h` moved to `shared/include/`
- ✅ Common logger copied to `shared/src/`
- ✅ Both projects configured to use shared includes

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Builds**: Verify both projects compile successfully
2. **Update Include Paths**: If needed, fix any remaining hardcoded paths
3. **OTA Implementation**: Complete the R4 WiFi flash driver for OTA updates
4. **Documentation**: Update project-specific documentation

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Testing Controller
```bash
cd controller
pio run --target upload
# Test telnet commands at device IP:23
telnet 192.168.1.225 23
> help
> show
> ota start
```

### Testing Monitor
```bash  
cd monitor
pio run --target upload
# Test sensor monitoring via telnet
telnet 192.168.1.225 23
> show
> temp read
> weight read
```

## 🔧 VS Code Integration

Use the generated workspace file:
- Open `LogSplitter_Reorganized.code-workspace` in VS Code
- All projects will be available in the sidebar
- IntelliSense configured for shared includes
- PlatformIO integration ready for both projects

**The project is now properly organized and ready for independent development of the controller and monitor systems!** 🎉
